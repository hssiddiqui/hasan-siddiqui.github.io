Hasan is a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University. His research is focused on energy access in sub-Saharan Africa by utlizing remote sensing tools and surveys to study small-holder irrigation. The identification of these areas help model costs for electrification of a community either through stand-alone mini-grids or connection to a centralized grid. The outcome is subsequent reduction of energy poverty through increased agricultural productivity. Some of his projects are:
- Dry Season Smallholder Irrigation Detection in Sub-Saharan Africa
- GEE EVI timeseries inspection app
- Cloud Computing and Big Data Projects
